# Bot Hunt

"Bot Hunt" is a simple yet engaging game developed on the Stanford Code in Place platform. The objective is to navigate your "bot" to the "goal" while avoiding the "destroyer," which grows and speeds up as you score points!

## Game Overview

In Bot Hunt, you control a small grey square (your bot). Your mission is to reach the rosy brown square (the goal) as many times as possible. However, a black square (the destroyer) is constantly moving around the canvas. If the destroyer touches your bot, it's game over!

As you score points by reaching the goal, the destroyer will increase in size and the game's speed will increase, making it progressively more challenging.

## How to Play

1.  **Launch the Game**: Run the Python script on the Stanford Code in Place platform.
2.  **Select Difficulty**: On the initial screen, click on "Easy," "Medium," or "Hard" to choose your desired difficulty level.
3.  **Controls**: Once the game starts, use the **Arrow Keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move your bot.
4.  **Score Points**: Guide your bot to the rosy brown "goal" square to score a point. A new goal will appear randomly on the canvas.
5.  **Avoid the Destroyer**: Stay clear of the black "destroyer" square. If it overlaps with your bot, the game ends.
6.  **Game Over**: The game ends if your bot hits the destroyer or moves off the canvas boundaries. Your final score will be displayed.

## Game Elements Explained

* **Bot** (Grey Square): Your controllable character.
* **Goal** (Rosy Brown Square): The target you need to reach to score points.
* **Destroyer** (Black Square): The enemy that you must avoid. It bounces off walls and increases in size and speed as you score.

## Features

* **Difficulty Levels**: Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard, which affects the initial speed of the destroyer.
* **Dynamic Difficulty**: The destroyer grows larger and moves faster as your score increases, providing a continuous challenge.
* **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your points during the game.
